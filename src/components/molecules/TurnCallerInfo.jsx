        Turn caller is a web app I created thinking of medical offices that
        share waiting rooms. <br />
        The web app has three profiles. <br />
        The first one is for the receptionist, where patients can be added,
        deleted, or called. <br />
        The second is for the waiting room, where patients can see and hear when
        called.
        <br /> Finally the third one is for doctors, the doctor will enter a
        code that will identify them in a medical office, and the app will
        filter only the patients waiting to see them and call them when it is
        time.
