        ToDo List is a web app I coded for productivity, it helps users organize
        and complete tasks.
        <br /> <br />
        This app allows adding a new task, marking assignments as completed, or
        deleting them. The user can search for specific tasks on the list with
        the search bar at the top.
        <br /> <br />
        Using the top counter, know how far you are from finishing all your
        ToDoÂ´s.
