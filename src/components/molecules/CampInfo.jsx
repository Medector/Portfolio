        Hey, thanks for inquiring on the camp website! <br />
        This is a static page made by me to practice the use of HTML and CSS.
        <br /> This is a webpage was created for an imaginary camping site.
        There are many attractive images of the camping site and its activities.
        <br />
        This page is like a template to see some things that can be done with
        only CSS and HTML.
      </text>
    </div>
