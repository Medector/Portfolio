        <h1> Hello World! </h1>
        My name is Hector Medina; I am an M.D. from Mexico. I have many hobbies
        and am interested in many things, but I have always been passionate
        about biology and technology all my life since I can remember. <br />
        <br />
        For most of my life, I saw myself only as a consumer of technology
        rather than a developer, as there wasn't much information about how to
        become one, and universities in my area didn't have exciting careers in
        informatics.
        <br />
        Throughout the years, I started to plan on becoming a medical doctor,
        and In the context I lived, it was the most straightforward path to
        exploit my passion for biology and human health.
        <br />
        <br />
        I got my Medical degree at the Universidad Autonoma de Coahuila.
        <br />
        <br />
        Technology and learning informatics became more and more accessible as
        the years passed. So I found a great way to merge both of my passions.
        So I started studying informatics not to change careers but to build up
        and expand my abilities.
